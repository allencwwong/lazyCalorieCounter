# What I ate

Apis
-Clarifai
-FaunaDB
-Formspree

Things We will need to do:

A page that allows the user to upload the image. Which sends the image to the clarifai to analsyis.
Then return a list of ingredients that the user can remove or add. User can click submit to add into DB (Fauna). This page can let us reupload img, cancel entry, add entry, add/remove ingredients, date, title/description

A page that shows all the user uploaded images in a grid format. When user clicks on an image, the sidebar (maybe overlay) will show the ingredients of the food.
